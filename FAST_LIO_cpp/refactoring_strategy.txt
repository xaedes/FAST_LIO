Goal: Create new cmake library independent of ros with functionality of FAST_LIO

Copy old code into seperate directory containing the new library.

Remove ros dependencies from new code.
Replace fast_lio dependencies in old code with library usage.

A lot of functions directly accept ROS messages. 
This makes it efficient for usage in ROS, but it needs ROS to build the header files.
We want to keep performance, but make ROS optional.
The interface for the messages is well defined and can be trivially mirrored in simple structs.
The code working on message data will then be templated to accept both simple structs and ROS messages.
